The data supports not only sorting but also language-sensitive searching and grouping under index headers. All CLDR collations are based on the [<a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr41/#UTS10">UCA</a>] default order, with common modifications applied in the CLDR root collation, and further tailored for language and style as needed.</p><h3 id="11-cldr-collation-algorithm">1.1 <a name="CLDR_Collation_Algorithm" href="#CLDR_Collation_Algorithm">CLDR Collation Algorithm</a></h3><p>The CLDR collation algorithm is an extension of the <a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/#Main_Algorithm">Unicode Collation Algorithm</a>.</p><h4 id="111-ufffe">1.1.1 <a name="Algorithm_FFFE" href="#Algorithm_FFFE">U+FFFE</a></h4><p>U+FFFE maps to a CE with a minimal, unique primary weight. Its primary weight is not "variable": U+FFFE must not become ignorable in alternate handling. On the identical level, a minimal, unique “weight” must be emitted for U+FFFE as well. This allows for <a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/#Merging_Sort_Keys">Merging Sort Keys</a> within code point space.</p><p>For example, when sorting names in a database, a sortable string can be formed with <em>last_name</em> + '\uFFFE' + <em>first_name</em>. These strings would sort properly, without ever comparing the last part of a last name with the first part of another first name.</p><p>For backwards secondary level sorting, text <em>segments</em> separated by U+FFFE are processed in forward segment order, and <em>within</em> each segment the secondary weights are compared backwards. This is so that such combined strings are processed consistently with merging their sort keys (for example, by concatenating them level by level with a low separator).</p><blockquote>
<p>👉 <strong>Note</strong>: With unique, low weights on <em>all</em> levels it is possible to achieve <code>sortkey(str1 + "\uFFFE" + str2) == mergeSortkeys(sortkey(str1), sortkey(str2))</code> . When that is not necessary, then code can be a little simpler (no special handling for U+FFFE except for backwards-secondary), sort keys can be a little shorter (when using compressible common non-primary weights for U+FFFE), and another low weight can be used in tailorings.</p>
</blockquote><h4 id="112-context-sensitive-mappings">1.1.2 <a name="Context_Sensitive_Mappings" href="#Context_Sensitive_Mappings">Context-Sensitive Mappings</a></h4><p>Contraction matching, as in the UCA, starts from the first character of the contraction string. It slows down processing of that first character even when none of its contractions matches. In some cases, it is preferrable to change such contractions to mappings with a prefix (context before a character), so that complex processing is done only when the less-frequently occurring trailing character is encountered.</p><p>For example, the DUCET contains contractions for several variants of L· (L followed by middle dot). Collating ASCII text is slowed down by contraction matching starting with L/l. In the CLDR root collation, these contractions are replaced by prefix mappings (L|·) which are triggered only when the middle dot is encountered. CLDR also uses prefix rules in the Japanese tailoring, for processing of Hiragana/Katakana length and iteration marks.</p><p>The mapping is conditional on the prefix match but does not change the mappings for the preceding text. As a result, a contraction mapping for "px" can be replaced by a prefix rule "p|x" only if px maps to the collation elements for p followed by the collation elements for "x if after p". In the DUCET, L· maps to CE(L) followed by a special secondary CE (which differs from CE(·) when · is not preceded by L). In the CLDR root collation, L has no context-sensitive mappings, but · maps to that special secondary CE if preceded by L.</p><p>A prefix mapping for p|x behaves mostly like the contraction px, except when there is a contraction that overlaps with the prefix, for example one for "op". A contraction matches only new text (and consumes it), while a prefix matches only already-consumed text.</p><ul>
<li>  With mappings for "op" and "px", only the first contraction matches in text "opx". (It consumes the "op" characters, and there is no context-sensitive mapping for x.)</li>
<li>  With mappings for "op" and "p|x", both the contraction and the prefix rule match in text "opx". (The prefix always matches already-consumed characters, regardless of whether they mapped as part of contractions.)</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p>👉 <strong>Note</strong>: Matching of discontiguous contractions should be implemented without rewriting the text (unlike in the [<a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr41/#UTS10">UCA</a>] algorithm specification), so that prefix matching is predictable. (It should also help with contraction matching performance.) An implementation that does rewrite the text, as in the UCA, will get different results for some (unusual) combinations of contractions, prefix rules, and input text.</p>
</blockquote><p>Prefix matching uses a simple longest-match algorithm (op|c wins over p|c). It is recommended that prefix rules be limited to mappings where both the prefix string and the mapped string begin with an NFC boundary (that is, with a normalization starter that does not combine backwards). (In op|ch both o and c should be starters (ccc=0) and NFC_QC=Yes.) Otherwise, prefix matching would be affected by canonical reordering and discontiguous matching, like contractions. Prefix matching is thus always contiguous.</p><p>A character can have mappings with both prefixes (context before) and contraction suffixes. Prefixes are matched first. This is to keep them reasonably implementable: When there is a mapping with both a prefix and a contraction suffix (like in Japanese: ぐ|ゞ), then the matching needs to go in both directions. The contraction might involve discontiguous matching, which needs complex text iteration and handling of skipped combining marks, and will consume the matching suffix. Prefix matching should be first because, regardless of whether there is a match, the implementation will always return to the original text index (right after the prefix) from where it will start to look at all of the contractions for that prefix.</p><p>If there is a match for a prefix but no match for any of the suffixes for that prefix, then fall back to mappings with the next-longest matching prefix, and so on, ultimately to mappings with no prefix. (Otherwise mappings with longer prefixes would “hide” mappings with shorter prefixes.)</p><p>Consider the following mappings.</p><ol>
<li>p → CE(p)</li>
<li>h → CE(h)</li>
<li>c → CE(c)</li>
<li>ch → CE(d)</li>
<li>p|c → CE(u)</li>
<li>p|ci → CE(v)</li>
<li>p|ĉ → CE(w)</li>
<li>op|ck → CE(x)</li>
</ol><p>With these, text collates like this:</p><ul>
<li>pc → CE(p)CE(u)</li>
<li>pci → CE(p)CE(v)</li>
<li>pch → CE(p)CE(u)CE(h)</li>
<li>pĉ → CE(p)CE(w)</li>
<li>pĉ̣ → CE(p)CE(w)CE(U+0323) // discontiguous</li>
<li>opck → CE(o)CE(p)CE(x)</li>
<li>opch → CE(o)CE(p)CE(u)CE(h)</li>
</ul><p>However, if the mapping p|c → CE(u) is missing, then text "pch" maps to CE(p)CE(d), "opch" maps to CE(o)CE(p)CE(d), and "pĉ̣" maps to CE(p)CE(c)CE(U+0323)CE(U+0302) (because discontiguous contraction matching extends <em>an existing match</em> by one non-starter at a time).</p><h4 id="113-case-handling">1.1.3 <a name="Algorithm_Case" href="#Algorithm_Case">Case Handling</a></h4><p>CLDR specifies how to sort lowercase or uppercase first, as a stronger distinction than other tertiary variants (<strong>caseFirst</strong>) or while completely ignoring all other tertiary distinctions (<strong>caseLevel</strong>). See <em>Section 3.3 <a href="#Setting_Options">Setting Options</a></em> and <em>Section 3.13 <a href="#Case_Parameters">Case Parameters</a></em>.</p><h4 id="114-reordering-groups">1.1.4 <a name="Algorithm_Reordering_Groups" href="#Algorithm_Reordering_Groups">Reordering Groups</a></h4><p>CLDR specifies how to do parametric reordering of groups of scripts (e.g., “native script first”) as well as special groups (e.g., “digits after letters”), and provides data for the effective implementation of such reordering.</p><h4 id="115-combining-rules">1.1.5 <a name="Combining_Rules" href="#Combining_Rules">Combining Rules</a></h4><p>Rules from different sources can be combined, with the later rules overriding the earlier ones. The following is an example of how this can be useful.</p><p>There is a root collation for "emoji" in CLDR. So use of "-u-co-emoji" in a Unicode locale identifier will access that ordering.</p><p>Example, using ICU:</p><pre><code class="language-java">collator = Collator.getInstance(ULocale.forLanguageTag(<span class="hljs-string">"en-u-co-emoji"</span>));
</code></pre><p>However, use of the emoji will supplant the language's customizations. So the above is the equivalent of:</p><pre><code class="language-java">collator = Collator.getInstance(ULocale.forLanguageTag(<span class="hljs-string">"und-u-co-emoji"</span>));
</code></pre><p>The same structure will not work for a language that does require customization, like Danish. That is, the following will fail.</p><pre><code class="language-java">collator = Collator.getInstance(ULocale.forLanguageTag(<span class="hljs-string">"da-u-co-emoji"</span>));
</code></pre><p>For that, a slightly more cumbersome method needs to be employed, which is to take the rules for Danish, and explicitly add the rules for emoji.</p><pre><code class="language-java"><span class="hljs-type">RuleBasedCollator</span> <span class="hljs-variable">collator</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">RuleBasedCollator</span>(
((RuleBasedCollator) Collator.getInstance(ULocale.forLanguageTag(<span class="hljs-string">"da"</span>))).getRules() +
((RuleBasedCollator) Collator.getInstance(ULocale.forLanguageTag(<span class="hljs-string">"und-u-co-emoji"</span>)))
.getRules());
</code></pre><p>The following table shows the differences. When emoji ordering is supported, the two faces will be adjacent. When Danish ordering is supported, the ü is after the y.</p><!-- HTML: no header row, jagged --><table><tbody>

It is used by all other locales by default, or as the base for their tailorings. (For a chart view of the UCA, see Collation Chart [<a href="tr35.html#UCAChart">UCAChart</a>].)</p><p>Starting with CLDR 1.9, CLDR uses modified tables for the root collation order. The root locale ordering is tailored in the following ways:</p><h3 id="21-grouping-classes-of-characters">2.1 <a name="grouping_classes_of_characters" href="#grouping_classes_of_characters">Grouping classes of characters</a></h3><p>As of Version 6.1.0, the DUCET puts characters into the following ordering:</p><ul>
<li>First "common characters": whitespace, punctuation, general symbols, some numbers, currency symbols, and other numbers.</li>
<li>Then "script characters": Latin, Greek, and the rest of the scripts.</li>
</ul><p>(There are a few exceptions to this general ordering.)</p><p>The CLDR root locale modifies the DUCET tailoring by ordering the common characters more strictly by category:</p><ul>
<li>whitespace, punctuation, general symbols, currency symbols, and numbers.</li>
</ul><p>What the regrouping allows is for users to parametrically reorder the groups. For example, users can reorder numbers after all scripts, or reorder Greek before Latin.</p><p>The relative order within each of these groups still matches the DUCET. Symbols, punctuation, and numbers that are grouped with a particular script stay with that script. The differences between CLDR and the DUCET order are:</p><ol>
<li><p>CLDR groups the numbers together after currency symbols, instead of splitting them with some before and some after. Thus the following are put <em>after</em> currencies and just before all the other numbers.</p>

With the <em>shifted</em> option, almost all symbols and punctuation are ignored—except at a fourth level. The CLDR root locale ordering is modified so that symbols are not affected by the <em>shifted</em> option. That is, by default, symbols are not “variable” in CLDR. So <em>shifted</em> only causes whitespace and punctuation to be ignored, but not symbols (like ♥). The DUCET behavior can be specified with a locale ID using the "kv" keyword, to set the Variable section to include all of the symbols below it, or be set parametrically where implementations allow access.</p><p>See also:</p><ul>

<p><strong>U+FFFF:</strong> This code point is tailored to have a primary weight higher than all other characters. This allows the reliable specification of a range, such as “Sch” ≤ X ≤ “Sch\uFFFF”, to include all strings starting with "sch" or equivalent.</p>
<p><strong>U+FFFE:</strong> This code point produces a CE with minimal, unique weights on primary and identical levels. For details see the <em><a href="#Algorithm_FFFE">CLDR Collation Algorithm</a></em> above.</p>
</blockquote><p>UCA (beginning with version 6.3) also maps <strong>U+FFFD</strong> to a special collation element with a very high primary weight, so that it is reliably non-<a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/#Variable_Weighting">variable</a>, for use with <a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/#Handling_Illformed">ill-formed code unit sequences</a>.</p><p>In CLDR, so as to maintain the special collation elements, <strong>U+FFFD..U+FFFF</strong> are not further tailorable, and nothing can tailor to them.

<li><p><strong>FractionalUCA</strong> - A file that provides a remapping of UCA DUCET weights for use with CLDR. The weight values are modified:</p>
<ul>
<li>The weights have variable length, with 1..4 bytes each. Each secondary or tertiary weight currently uses at most 2 bytes.</li>
<li>There are tailoring gaps between adjacent weights, so that a number of characters can be tailored to sort between any two root collation elements.</li>
<li>There are collation elements with primary weights at the boundaries between reordering groups and Unicode scripts, so that tailoring around the first or last primary of a group/script results in new collation elements that sort and reorder together with that group or script. These boundary weights also define the primary weight ranges for parametric group and script reordering.</li>
</ul>
<p>An implementation may modify the weights further to fit the needs of its data structures.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>UCA_Rules</strong> - A file that specifies the root collation order in the form of <a href="#Collation_Tailorings">tailoring rules</a>. This is only an approximation of the FractionalUCA data, since the rule syntax cannot express every detail of the collation elements. For example, in the DUCET and in FractionalUCA, tertiary differences are usually expressed with special tertiary weights on all collation elements of an expansion, while a typical from-rules builder will modify the tertiary weight of only one of the collation elements.</p>

Beginning with CLDR 26, the CJK type="unihan" tailorings assume that the root collation order sorts Han characters in Unihan radical-stroke order according to the <code>[radical ...]</code> data. The CollationTest_CLDR files only contain Han characters that are in the same relative order using implicit weights or the radical-stroke order.</p><p>The root collation radical-stroke order is derived from the first (normative) values of the <a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr38/#kRSUnicode">Unihan kRSUnicode</a> field for each Han character. Han characters are ordered by radical, with traditional forms sorting before simplified ones. Characters with the same radical are ordered by residual stroke count.

Each collation element has 3 parts separated by commas: the primary weight, secondary weight, and tertiary weight. The tertiary weight actually consists of two components: the top two bits (0xC0) are used for the <em>case level</em>, and should be masked off where a case level is not used.</p><p>A weight is either empty (meaning a zero or ignorable weight) or is a sequence of one or more bytes. The bytes are interpreted as a "fraction", meaning that the ordering is 04 &lt; 05 05 &lt; 06. The weights are constructed so that no weight is an initial subsequence of another: that is, having both the weights 05 and 05 05 is illegal. The above line consists of all ignorable weights.</p><p>The vertical bar (“|”) character is used to indicate context, as in:</p><pre><code>006C | 00B7; [, DB A9, 05]
</code></pre><p>This example indicates that if U+00B7 appears immediately after U+006C, it is given the corresponding collation element instead. This syntax is roughly equivalent to the following contraction, but is more efficient. For details see the specification of <em><a href="#Context_Sensitive_Mappings">Context-Sensitive Mappings</a></em> above.</p><pre><code>006C 00B7; CE(006C) [, DB A9, 05]

</code></pre><p>Some collation elements are specified by reference to other mappings. This is particularly useful for Han characters which are given implicit/constructed primary weights; the reference to a Unified_Ideograph makes these mappings independent of implementation details. This technique may also be used in other mappings to show the relationship of character variants.</p><p>The referenced character must have a mapping listed earlier in the file, or the mapping must have been defined via the [Unified_Ideograph] data line. The referenced character must map to exactly one collation element.</p><p><code>[U+4E0D]</code> copies U+4E0D’s entire collation element. <code>[U+4E36, 10]</code> copies U+4E36’s primary and secondary weights and specifies a different tertiary weight. <code>[U+4E36, 70, 20]</code> only copies U+4E36’s primary weight and specifies other secondary and tertiary weights.</p><p>FractionalUCA.txt does not have any explicit mappings for implicit weights. Therefore, an implementation is free to choose an algorithm for computing implicit weights according to the principles specified in the UCA.</p><pre><code>FDD1 20AC;      [0D 20 02, 05, 05]      # CURRENCY first primary

</code></pre><p>These are special mappings with primaries at the boundaries of scripts and reordering groups. They serve as tailoring boundaries, so that tailoring near the first or last character of a script or group places the tailored item into the same group. Beginning with CLDR 24, each of these is a contraction of U+FDD1 with a character of the corresponding script (or of the General_Category [Z, P, S, Sc, Nd] corresponding to a special reordering group), mapping to the first possible primary weight per script or group. They can be enumerated for implementations of <a href="#Collation_Indexes">Collation Indexes</a>. (Earlier versions mapped contractions with U+FDD0 to the last primary weights of each group but not each script.)</p><p>Beginning with CLDR 27, these mappings alone define the boundaries for reordering single scripts. (There are no mappings for Hrkt, Hans, or Hant because they are not fully distinct scripts; they share primary weights with other scripts: Hrkt=Hira=Kana &amp; Hans=Hant=Hani.) There are some reserved ranges, beginning at boundaries marked with U+FDD0 plus following characters as shown above. The reserved ranges are not used for collation elements and are not available for tailoring.</p><p>Some primary lead bytes must be reserved so that reordering of scripts along partial-lead-byte boundaries can “split” the primary lead byte and use up a reserved byte. This is for implementations that write sort keys, which must reorder primary weights by offsetting them by whole lead bytes. There are reorder-reserved ranges before and after Latin, so that reordering scripts with few primary lead bytes relative to Latin can move those scripts into the reserved ranges without changing the primary weights of any other script. Each of these boundaries begins with a new two-byte primary; that is, no two groups/scripts/ranges share the top 16 bits of their primary weights.</p><pre><code>FDD0 0034;      [11, 05, 05]    # lead byte for numeric sorting
</code></pre><p>This mapping specifies the lead byte for numeric sorting. It must be different from the lead byte of any other primary weight, otherwise numeric sorting would generate ill-formed collation elements. Therefore, this mapping itself must be excluded from the set of regular mappings. This value can be ignored by implementations that do not support numeric sorting. (Other contractions with U+FDD0 can normally be ignored altogether.)</p><pre><code># HOMELESS COLLATION ELEMENTS

</code></pre><p>The DUCET has some weights that don't correspond directly to a character. To allow for implementations to have a mapping for each collation element (necessary for certain implementations of tailoring), this requires the construction of special sequences for those weights. These collation elements can normally be ignored.</p><p>Next, a number of tables are defined. The function of each of the tables is summarized afterwards.</p><pre><code># VALUES BASED ON UCA

</code></pre><p>This table defines the reordering groups, for script reordering. The table maps from the first bytes of the fractional weights to a reordering token. The format is "[top_byte " byte-value reordering-token "COMPRESS"? "]". The "COMPRESS" value is present when there is only one byte in the reordering token, and primary-weight compression can be applied. Most reordering tokens are script values; others are special-purpose values, such as PUNCTUATION. Beginning with CLDR 24, this table precedes the regular mappings, so that parsers can use this information while processing and optimizing mappings. Beginning with CLDR 27, most of this data is irrelevant because single scripts can be reordered. Only the "COMPRESS" data is still useful.</p><pre><code># Reordering Tokens =&gt; Top Bytes

An implementation is free to move them if it also moves the explicit TRAILING weights.

</ul><h4 id="342-notes-on-the-normalization-setting">3.4.2 <a name="Normalization_Setting" href="#Normalization_Setting">Notes on the normalization setting</a></h4><p>The UCA always normalizes input strings into NFD form before the rest of the algorithm. However, this results in poor performance.</p><p>With <strong>normalization=off</strong>, strings that are in [<a href="tr35.html#FCD">FCD</a>] and do not contain Tibetan precomposed vowels (U+0F73, U+0F75, U+0F81) should sort correctly. With <strong>normalization=on</strong>, an implementation that does not normalize to NFD must at least perform an incremental FCD check and normalize substrings as necessary. It should also always decompose the Tibetan precomposed vowels. (Otherwise discontiguous contractions across their leading components cannot be handled correctly.)</p><p>Another complication for an implementation that does not always use NFD arises when contraction mappings overlap with canonical Decomposition_Mapping strings. For example, the Danish contraction “aa” overlaps with the decompositions of ‘ä’, ‘å’, and other characters. In the root collation (and in the DUCET), Cyrillic ‘ӛ’ maps to a single collation element, which means that its decomposition “ә+◌̈” forms a contraction, and its second character (U+0308) is the same as the first character in the Decomposition_Mapping of U+0344 ‘◌̈́’=“◌̈+◌́”.</p><p>In order to handle strings with these characters (e.g., “aä” and “ӛ́” [which are in FCD]) exactly as with prior NFD normalization, an implementation needs to either add overlap contractions to its data (e.g., “a+ä” and “ә+◌̈́”), or it needs to decompose the relevant composites (e.g., ‘ä’ and ‘◌̈́’) as soon as they are encountered.</p><h4 id="343-notes-on-variable-top-settings">3.4.3 <a name="Variable_Top_Settings" href="#Variable_Top_Settings">Notes on variable top settings</a></h4><p>Users may want to include more or fewer characters as Variable. For example, someone could want to restrict the Variable characters to just include space marks. In that case, maxVariable would be set to "space". (In CLDR 24 and earlier, the now-deprecated variableTop would be set to U+1680, see the “Whitespace” <a href="https://unicode.org/charts/collation/">UCA collation chart</a>). Alternatively, someone could want more of the Common characters in them, and include characters up to (but not including) '0', by setting maxVariable to "currency". (In CLDR 24 and earlier, the now-deprecated variableTop would be set to U+20BA, see the “Currency-Symbol” collation chart).</p><p>The effect of these settings is to customize to ignore different sets of characters when comparing strings. For example, the locale identifier "de-u-ka-shifted-kv-currency" is requesting settings appropriate for German, including German sorting conventions, and that currency symbols and characters sorting below them are ignored in sorting.</p><h3 id="35-collation-rule-syntax">3.5 <a name="Rules" href="#Rules">Collation Rule Syntax</a></h3><pre><code class="language-xml"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;!ELEMENT <span class="hljs-keyword">cr</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">#PCDATA</span> &gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>The goal for the collation rule syntax is to have clearly expressed rules with a concise format. The CLDR rule syntax is a subset of the [<a href="tr35.html#ICUCollation">ICUCollation</a>] syntax.</p><p>For the CLDR root collation, the FractionalUCA.txt file defines all mappings for all of Unicode directly, and it also provides information about script boundaries, reordering groups, and other details. For tailorings, this is neither necessary nor practical. In particular, while the root collation sort order rarely changes for existing characters, their numeric collation weights change with every version. If tailorings also specified numeric weights directly, then they would have to change with every version, parallel with the root collation. Instead, for tailorings, mappings are added and modified relative to the root collation. (There is no syntax to <em>remove</em> mappings, except via <a href="#Special_Purpose_Commands">special [suppressContractions [...]]</a> .)</p><p>The ASCII [:P:] and [:S:] characters are reserved for collation syntax: <code>[\u0021-\u002F \u003A-\u0040 \u005B-\u0060 \u007B-\u007E]</code></p><p>Unicode Pattern_White_Space characters between tokens are ignored. Unquoted white space terminates reset and relation strings.</p><p>A pair of ASCII apostrophes encloses quoted literal text. They are normally used to enclose a syntax character or white space, or a whole reset/relation string containing one or more such characters, so that those are parsed as part of the reset/relation strings rather than treated as syntax. A pair of immediately adjacent apostrophes is used to encode one apostrophe.</p><p>Code points can be escaped with <code>\uhhhh</code> and <code>\U00hhhhhh</code> escapes, as well as common escapes like <code>\t</code> and <code>\n</code> . (For details see the documentation of ICU <code>UnicodeString::unescape()</code>.) This is particularly useful for default-ignorable code points, combining marks, visually indistinct variants, hard-to-type characters, etc. These sequences are unescaped before the rules are parsed; this means that even escaped syntax and white space characters need to be enclosed in apostrophes. For example: <code>&amp;'\u0020'='\u3000'</code>. Note: The unescaping is done by ICU tools (genrb) and demos before passing rule strings into the ICU library code. The ICU collation API does not unescape rule strings.</p><p>The ASCII double quote must be both escaped (so that the collation syntax can be enclosed in pairs of double quotes in programming environments such as ICU resource bundle .txt files) and quoted. For example: <code>&amp;'\u0022'&lt;&lt;&lt;x</code></p><p>Comments are allowed at the beginning, and after any complete reset, relation, setting, or command. A comment begins with a <code>#</code> and extends to the end of the line (according to the Unicode Newline Guidelines).</p><p>The collation syntax is case-sensitive.</p><h3 id="36-orderings">3.6 <a name="Orderings" href="#Orderings">Orderings</a></h3><p>The root collation mappings form the initial state. Mappings are added and removed via a sequence of rule chains. Each tailoring rule builds on the current state after all of the preceding rules (and is not affected by any following rules). Rule chains may alternate with comments, settings, and special commands.</p><p>A rule chain consists of a reset followed by one or more relations. The reset position is a string which maps to one or more collation elements according to the current state. A relation consists of an operator and a string; it maps the string to the current collation elements, modified according to the operator.</p><table><caption id="table-specifying-collation-ordering">Table: <a name="Specifying_Collation_Ordering" href="#Specifying_Collation_Ordering">Specifying Collation Ordering</a></caption>

</tbody></table><p>This is not always possible because prefix and extension strings can occur in a relation but not in a reset (see below).</p><p>The relation operator <code>=</code> maps its relation string to the current collation elements. Any other relation operator modifies the current collation elements as follows.</p><ul>
<li>Find the <em>last</em> collation element whose strength is at least as great as the strength of the operator. For example, for <code>&lt;&lt;</code> find the last primary or secondary CE. This CE will be modified; all following CEs should be removed. If there is no such CE, then reset the collation elements to a single completely-ignorable CE.</li>
<li>Increment the collation element weight corresponding to the strength of the operator. For example, for <code>&lt;&lt;</code> increment the secondary weight.</li>
<li>The new weight must be less than the next weight for the same combination of higher-level weights of any collation element according to the current state.</li>
<li>Weights must be allocated in accordance with the <a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/#Well-Formed">UCA well-formedness conditions</a>.</li>
<li>When incrementing any weight, lower-level weights should be reset to the “common” values, to help with sort key compression.</li>
</ul><p>In all cases, even for <code>=</code> , the case bits are recomputed according to <em>Section 3.13, <a href="#Case_Parameters">Case Parameters</a></em>. (This can be skipped if an implementation does not support the caseLevel or caseFirst settings.)</p><p>For example, <code>&amp;ae&lt;x</code> maps ‘x’ to two collation elements. The first one is the same as for ‘a’, and the second one has a primary weight between those for ‘e’ and ‘f’. As a result, ‘x’ sorts between “ae” and “af”. (If the primary of the first collation element was incremented instead, then ‘x’ would sort after “az”. While also sorting primary-after “ae” this would be surprising and sub-optimal.)</p><p>Some additional operators are provided to save space with large tailorings. The addition of a * to the relation operator indicates that each of the following single characters are to be handled as if they were separate relations with the corresponding strength. Each of the following single characters must be NFD-inert, that is, it does not have a canonical decomposition and it does not reorder (ccc=0). This keeps abbreviated rules unambiguous.</p><p>A starred relation operator is followed by a sequence of characters with the same quoting/escaping rules as normal relation strings. Such a sequence can also be followed by one or more pairs of ‘-’ and another sequence of characters. The single characters adjacent to the ‘-’ establish a code point order range. The same character cannot be both the end of a range and the start of another range. (For example, <code>&lt;a-d-g</code> is not allowed.)</p><table><caption id="table-abbreviating-ordering-specifications">Table: <a name="Abbreviating_Ordering_Specifications" href="#Abbreviating_Ordering_Specifications">Abbreviating Ordering Specifications</a></caption>

This is normally the result of a reset position (and/or preceding relation) that yields multiple collation elements, for example <code>&amp;ae&lt;x</code> or <code>&amp;æ&lt;y</code> .</p><p>A relation string can also be followed by <code>/</code> and an <em>extension string</em>. The extension string is mapped to collation elements according to the current state, and the relation string is mapped to the concatenation of the regular CEs and the extension CEs. The extension CEs are not modified, not even their case bits. The extension CEs are <em>not</em> retained for following relations.</p><p>For example, <code>&amp;a&lt;z/e</code> maps ‘z’ to an expansion similar to <code>&amp;ae&lt;x</code> . However, the first CE of ‘z’ is primary-after that of ‘a’, and the second CE is exactly that of ‘e’, which yields the order ae &lt; x &lt; af &lt; ag &lt; ... &lt; az &lt; z &lt; b.</p><p>The choice of reset-to-expansion vs. use of an extension string can be exploited to affect contextual mappings. For example, <code>&amp;L·=x</code> yields a second CE for ‘x’ equal to the context-sensitive middle-dot-after-L (which is a secondary CE in the root collation). On the other hand, <code>&amp;L=x/·</code> yields a second CE of the middle dot by itself (which is a primary CE).</p><p>The two ways of specifying expansions also differ in how case bits are computed. When some of the CEs are copied verbatim from an extension string, then the relation string’s case bits are distributed over a smaller number of normal CEs. For example, <code>&amp;aE=Ch</code> yields an uppercase CE and a lowercase CE, but <code>&amp;a=Ch/E</code> yields a mixed-case CE (for ‘C’ and ‘h’ together) followed by an uppercase CE (copied from ‘E’).</p><p>In summary, there are two ways of specifying expansions which produce subtly different mappings. The use of extension strings is unusual but sometimes necessary.</p><h3 id="39-context-before">3.9 <a name="Context_Before" href="#Context_Before">Context Before</a></h3><p>A relation string can have a prefix (context before) which makes the mapping from the relation string to its tailored position conditional on the string occurring after that prefix. For details see the specification of <em><a href="#Context_Sensitive_Mappings">Context-Sensitive Mappings</a></em>.</p><p>For example, suppose that "-" is sorted like the previous vowel. Then one could have rules that take "a-", "e-", and so on. However, that means that every time a very common character (a, e, ...) is encountered, a system will slow down as it looks for possible contractions. An alternative is to indicate that when "-" is encountered, and it comes after an 'a', it sorts like an 'a', and so on.</p><table><caption id="table-specifying-previous-context">Table: <a name="Specifying_Previous_Context" href="#Specifying_Previous_Context">Specifying Previous Context</a></caption>

</tbody></table><p>Each of the above Names can be used with a reset to position characters relative to that logical position. That allows characters to be ordered before or after a <em>logical</em> position rather than a specific character.</p><blockquote>
<p>👉 <strong>Note</strong>: The reason for this is so that tailorings can be more stable. A future version of the UCA might add characters at any point in the above list. Suppose that you set character X to be after Y. It could be that you want X to come after Y, no matter what future characters are added; or it could be that you just want Y to come after a given logical position, for example, after the last primary ignorable.</p>
</blockquote><p>Each of these special reset positions always maps to a single collation element.</p><p>Here is an example of the syntax:</p><p><code>&amp; [first tertiary ignorable] &lt;&lt; à</code></p><p>For example, to make a character be a secondary ignorable, one can make it be immediately after (at a secondary level) a specific character (like a combining diaeresis), or one can make it be immediately after the last secondary ignorable.</p><p>Each special reset position adjusts to the effects of preceding rules, just like normal reset position strings. For example, if a tailoring rule creates a new collation element after <code>&amp;[last variable]</code> (via explicit tailoring after that, or via tailoring after the relevant character), then this new CE becomes the new <em>last variable</em> CE, and is used in following resets to <code>[last variable]</code> .</p><p>[first variable] and [first regular] and [first trailing] should be the first real such CEs (e.g., CE(U+0060 `)), as adjusted according to the tailoring, not the boundary CEs (see the FractionalUCA.txt “first primary” mappings starting with U+FDD1).</p><p><code>[last regular]</code> is not actually the last normal CE with a primary weight before implicit primaries. It is used to tailor large numbers of characters, usually CJK, into the script=Hani range between the last regular script and the first implicit CE. (The first group of implicit CEs is for Han characters.) Therefore, <code>[last regular]</code> is set to the first Hani CE, the artificial script boundary CE at the beginning of this range. For example: <code>&amp;[last regular]&lt;*亜唖娃阿...</code></p><p>The [last trailing] is the CE of U+FFFF. Tailoring to that is not allowed.</p><p>The <code>[last variable]</code> indicates the "highest" character that is treated as punctuation with alternate handling.</p><p>The value can be changed by using the maxVariable setting. This takes effect, however, after the rules have been built, and does not affect any characters that are reset relative to the <code>[last variable]</code> value when the rules are being built. The maxVariable setting might also be changed via a runtime parameter. That also does not affect the rules.
(In CLDR 24 and earlier, the variable top could also be set by using a tailoring rule with <code>[variable top]</code> in the place of a relation string.)</p><h3 id="312-special-purpose-commands">3.12 <a name="Special_Purpose_Commands" href="#Special_Purpose_Commands">Special-Purpose Commands</a></h3><p>The import command imports rules from another collation.

This reordering is done on top of any specific ordering rules within the script or block currently in effect.

Once that is determined, script reordering is applied to the primary weight regardless of whether it is “regular” (used in the primary level) or “shifted” (used in the quaternary level).</p><h4 id="3131-interpretation-of-a-reordering-list">3.13.1 <a name="Interpretation_reordering" href="#Interpretation_reordering">Interpretation of a reordering list</a></h4><p>The reordering list is interpreted as if it were processed in the following way.</p><ol>

</tbody></table><p>The default reordering groups are defined by the FractionalUCA.txt file, based on the primary weights of associated collation elements. The file contains special mappings for the start of each group, script, and reorder-reserved range, see <em>Section 2.6.2, <a href="#File_Format_FractionalUCA_txt">FractionalUCA.txt</a></em>.</p><p>There are some special cases:</p><ul>
<li>The <strong>Hani</strong> group includes implicit weights for <em>Han characters</em> according to the UCA as well as any characters tailored relative to a Han character, or after <code>&amp;[first Hani]</code>.</li>
<li>Implicit weights for <em>unassigned code points</em> according to the UCA reorder as the last weights in the <strong>others</strong> (<strong>Zzzz</strong>) group.
There is no script code to explicitly reorder the unassigned-implicit weights into a particular position. (Unassigned-implicit weights are used for non-Hani code points without any mappings. For a given Unicode version they are the code points with General_Category values Cn, Co, Cs.)</li>
<li>The TRAILING group, the FIELD-SEPARATOR (associated with U+FFFE), and collation elements with only zero primary weights are not reordered.</li>
<li>The TERMINATOR, LEVEL-SEPARATOR, and SPECIAL groups are never associated with characters.</li>
</ul><p>For example, <code>reorder="Hani Zzzz Grek"</code> sorts Hani, Latin, Cyrillic, ... (all other scripts) ..., unassigned, Greek, TRAILING.</p><p>Notes for implementations that write sort keys:</p><ul>
<li>Primaries must always be offset by one or more whole primary lead bytes. (Otherwise the number of bytes in a fractional weight may change, compressible scripts may span multiple lead bytes, or trailing primary bytes may collide with separators and primary-compression terminators.)</li>
<li>When a script is reordered that does not start and end on whole-primary-lead-byte boundaries, then the lead byte needs to be “split”, and a reserved byte is used up. The data supports this via reorder-reserved ranges of primary weights that are not used for collation elements.</li>
<li>Primary weights from different original lead bytes can be reordered to a shared lead byte, as long as they do not overlap. Primary compression ends when the target lead byte differs or when the original lead byte of the next primary is not compressible.</li>
<li>Non-compressible groups and scripts begin or end on whole-primary-lead-byte boundaries (or both), so that reordering cannot surround a non-compressible script by two compressible ones within the same target lead byte. This is so that primary compression can be terminated reliably (choosing the low or high terminator byte) simply by comparing the previous and current primary weights. Otherwise it would have to also check for another condition (e.g., equal scripts).</li>

The reordering groups for the DUCET are not specified. The following describes how reordering groups for the DUCET can be derived.</p><p>For allkeys_DUCET.txt, the start of each reordering group is normally the primary weight corresponding to the same character sequence as for allkeys_CLDR.txt. In a few cases this requires adjustment, especially for the special reordering groups, due to CLDR’s ordering the common characters more strictly by category than the DUCET (as described in <em>Section 2, <a href="#Root_Collation">Root Collation</a></em>). The necessary adjustment would set the start of each allkeys_DUCET.txt reordering group to the primary weight of the first mapping for the relevant General_Category for a special reordering group (for characters that sort before ‘a’), or the primary weight of the first mapping for the first script (e.g., sc=Grek) of an “alphabetic” group (for characters that sort at or after ‘a’).</p><p>Note that the following only applies to primary weights greater than the one for U+FFFE and less than "trailing" weights.</p><p>The special reordering groups correspond to General_Category values as follows:</p><ul>
<li>punct: P</li>
<li>symbol: Sk, Sm, So</li>
<li>space: Z, Cc</li>
<li>currency: Sc</li>
<li>digit: Nd</li>
</ul><p>In the DUCET, some characters that sort below ‘a’ and have other General_Category values not mentioned above (e.g., gc=Lm) are also grouped with symbols. Variants of numbers (gc=No or Nl) can be found among punctuation, symbols, and digits.</p><p>Each collation element of an expansion may be in a different reordering group, for example for parenthesized characters.</p><h3 id="314-case-parameters">3.14 <a name="Case_Parameters" href="#Case_Parameters">Case Parameters</a></h3><p>The <strong>case level</strong> is an <em>optional</em> intermediate level ("2.5") between Level 2 and Level 3 (or after Level 1, if there is no Level 2 due to strength settings). The case level is used to support two parametric features: ignoring non-case variants (Level 3 differences) except for case, and giving case differences a higher-level priority than other tertiary differences. Distinctions between small and large Kana characters are also included as case differences, to support Japanese collation.</p><p>The <strong>case first</strong> parameter controls whether to swap the order of upper and lowercase. It can be used with or without the case level.</p><p>Importantly, the case parameters have no effect in many instances. For example, they have no effect on the comparison of two non-ignorable characters with different primary weights, or with different secondary weights if the strength = <strong>secondary (or higher).</strong></p><p>When either the <strong>case level</strong> or <strong>case first</strong> parameters are set, the following describes the derivation of the modified collation elements.

Each character corresponds to a bucket in the target list. One may have different kinds of index lists; one that produces an index list that is relatively static, and the other is a list that produces roughly equally-sized buckets. While CLDR is mostly focused on the first, there is provision for supporting the second as well.</p><p>The index characters need to be used in conjunction with a collation for the locale, which will determine the order of the characters.

The use of the list requires that the target list be sorted according to the locale that is used to create that list. Although we say "character" above, the index character could be a sequence, like "CH" above. The index exemplar characters must always be used with a collation appropriate for the locale. Any characters that do not have primary differences from others in the set should be removed.</p><p>Details:</p><ol>
<li>The primary weight (according to the collation) is used to determine which bucket a string is in. There are special buckets for before the first character, between buckets of different scripts, and after the last bucket (and of a different script).</li>
<li>Characters in the <em>index characters</em> do not need to have distinct primary weights. That is, the <em>index characters</em> are adapted to the underlying collation: normally Ё is in the Е bucket for Russian, but if someone used a variant of Russian collation that distinguished them on a primary level, then Ё would show up as its own bucket.</li>
<li>If an <em>index character</em> string ends with a single "*" (U+002A), for example "Sch*" and "St*" in German, then there will be a separate bucket for the string minus the "*", for example "Sch" and "St", even if that string does not sort distinctly.</li>
<li>An <em>index character</em> can have multiple primary weights, for example "Æ" and "Sch". Names that have the same initial primary weights sort into this _index character_’s bucket. This can be achieved by using an upper-boundary string that is the concatenation of the <em>index character</em> and U+FFFF, for example "Æ\uFFFF" and "Sch\uFFFF". Names that sort greater than this upper boundary but less than the next index character are redirected to the last preceding single-primary index character (A and S for the examples here).</li>
</ol><p>For example, for index characters <code>[A Æ B R S {Sch*} {St*} T]</code> the following sample names are sorted into an index as shown.</p><ul>
<li>A — Adelbert, Afrika</li>
<li>Æ — Æsculap, Aesthet</li>
<li>B — Berlin</li>
<li>R — Rilke</li>
<li>S — Sacher, Seiler, Sultan</li>
<li>Sch — Schiller</li>
<li>St — Steiff</li>
<li>T — Thomas</li>
</ul><p>The … items are special: each is a bucket for everything else, either less or greater. They are inserted at the start and end of the index list, <em>and</em> on script boundaries. Each script has its own range, except where scripts sort primary-equal (e.g., Hira &amp; Kana). All characters that sort in one of the low reordering groups (whitespace, punctuation, symbols, currency symbols, digits) are treated as a single script for this purpose.</p><p>If you tailor a Greek character into the Cyrillic script, that Greek character will be bucketed (and sorted) among the Cyrillic ones.</p><p>Even in an implementation that reorders groups of scripts rather than single scripts, for example Hebrew together with Phoenician and Samaritan, the index boundaries are really script boundaries, <em>not</em> multi-script-group boundaries. So if you had a collation that reordered Hebrew after Ethiopic, you would still get index boundaries between the following (and in that order):</p><ol>
<li>Ethiopic</li>
<li>Hebrew</li>
<li>Phoenician <em>// included in the Hebrew reordering group</em></li>
<li>Samaritan <em>// included in the Hebrew reordering group</em></li>
<li>Devanagari</li>
</ol><p>(Beginning with CLDR 27, single scripts can be reordered.)</p><p>In the UI, an index character could also be omitted or grayed out if its bucket is empty. For example, if there is nothing in the bucket for Q, then Q could be omitted. That would be up to the implementation. Additional buckets could be added if other characters are present. For example, we might see something like the following:</p><table>

</code></pre><p>The display of the index characters can be modified with the Index labels elements, discussed in the <em>Part 2 General, Section 3.3, <a href="tr35-general.html#IndexLabels">Index Labels</a></em>.</p><h4 id="3162-cjk-index-markers">3.16.2 <a name="CJK_Index_Markers" href="#CJK_Index_Markers">CJK Index Markers</a></h4><p>Special index markers have been added to the CJK collations for stroke, pinyin, zhuyin, and unihan. These markers allow for effective and robust use of indexes for these collations.</p><p>The per-language index exemplar characters are not useful for collation indexes for CJK because for each such language there are multiple sort orders in use (for example, Chinese pinyin vs. stroke vs. unihan vs. zhuyin), and these sort orders use very different index characters. In addition, sometimes the boundary strings are different from the bucket label strings. For collations that contain index markers, the boundary strings and bucket labels should be derived from those index markers, ignoring the index exemplar characters.</p><p>For example, near the start of the pinyin tailoring there is the following:</p><pre><code class="language-html"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">p</span>&gt;</span> A<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">p</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-comment">&lt;!-- INDEX A --&gt;</span>

</code></pre><p>These indicate the boundaries of "buckets" that can be used for indexing. They are always two characters starting with the noncharacter U+FDD0, and thus will not occur in normal text. For pinyin the second character is A-Z; for unihan it is one of the radicals; and for stroke it is a character after U+2800 indicating the number of strokes, such as ⠁. For zhuyin the second character is one of the standard Bopomofo characters in the range U+3105 through U+3129.</p><p>The corresponding bucket label strings are the boundary strings with the leading U+FDD0 removed. For example, the Pinyin boundary string "\uFDD0A" yields the label string "A".</p><p>However, for stroke order, the label string is the stroke count (second character minus U+2800) as a decimal-digit number followed by 劃 (U+5283). For example, the stroke order boundary string "\uFDD0\u2805" yields the label string "5劃".</p><hr><p>Copyright © 2001–2022 Unicode, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
